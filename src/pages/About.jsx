            Hi, I'm Axel VandenHeuvel - a senior Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I’m passionate about building practical, intelligent systems at the intersection of AI, hardware, and software engineering.

          <p>
          I’m deeply curious about AI systems, and software engineering. I love solving problems that involve pushing technical boundaries, optimizing systems for efficiency, and turning ambitious ideas into real, working prototypes.
          </p>

            Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, weightlifting, and video games.
